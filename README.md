## fjalÃ«t

Dataset that contains words used in the Albanian language which can stand alone at least in some context. It's currently
tailored for the [**penda**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/quill) project.

### Getting Started

The dataset is contained in a text file named [**fjalet.txt**](fjalet.txt). Every word is contained in a line
of its own. The file [**te-padeshiruarat.txt**](te-padeshiruarat.txt) contains words that have ended up in our dataset
and that we've then removed, therefore we're keeping track of them so that we won't go back in loops.

We are looking to improve the structure and format, and more importantly increase the quality of these entries.

### Contributors
