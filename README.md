## fjalÃ«t

Dataset that contains words used in the Albanian language which can stand alone at least in some context. It's currently
tailored for the [**penda**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/quill) project.

### Getting Started

The dataset is contained in a text file named [**fjalet.txt**](fjalet.txt). Every word is contained in a line
of its own. We are looking to improve the structure and format, and more importantly increase the quality of these
entries.

### Contributors

following alphabetical list.
